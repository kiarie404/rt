Building a Minimal RISC-V Runtime in Rust

Let's tackle each of these points systematically to build our understanding and implementation.
1. What is a Runtime?

A runtime is the environment in which programs execute. It provides essential services like:

    Memory management (stack, heap)

    Processor initialization

    Interrupt handling

    Standard library support

    Program entry/exit handling

In embedded/no_std contexts, the runtime is often minimal and tailored to the specific hardware.
2. Cross-Compilation Explained

Cross-compilation is compiling code on one platform (host) to run on another (target). For RISC-V:

    Host: Typically x86_64 (your development machine)

    Target: RISC-V (e.g., riscv32i-unknown-none-elf)

Key components needed:

    Target specification (CPU architecture, features)

    Cross-compilation toolchain (rustc + linker)

    Appropriate core libraries for the target

3. Setting Up a RISC-V no_std Environment

Let's create a new project and configure it:
bash

cargo new riscv-runtime --lib
cd riscv-runtime

Edit Cargo.toml:
toml

[package]
name = "riscv-runtime"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
riscv = "0.10.1"  # For RISC-V specific intrinsics

Create .cargo/config.toml:
toml

[build]
target = "riscv32i-unknown-none-elf"

[target.riscv32i-unknown-none-elf]
rustflags = [
    "-C", "link-arg=-Tmemory.x",
    "-C", "link-arg=-Tlink.x",
]

Create memory.x (memory layout):
text

MEMORY {
    RAM : ORIGIN = 0x80000000, LENGTH = 16K
}

_stack_start = ORIGIN(RAM) + LENGTH(RAM);

Create link.x (linker script):
text

ENTRY(_start)

SECTIONS {
    .text : {
        *(.text._start)
        *(.text*)
    } > RAM
    
    .rodata : {
        *(.rodata*)
    } > RAM
    
    .data : {
        *(.data*)
    } > RAM
    
    .bss : {
        *(.bss*)
    } > RAM
}

4. Assembly Integration in Rust

Rust can integrate with assembly in several ways:

    Inline assembly (stable as of Rust 1.59):

rust

use core::arch::asm;

unsafe fn nop() {
    asm!("nop");
}

    External assembly files:

    Write separate .S files

    Link them via build.rs

    Declare functions as extern "C"

Example start.S:
assembly

.section .text._start
.global _start
_start:
    la sp, _stack_start
    j main

5. Implementing a Minimal Runtime

Let's create our runtime in src/lib.rs:
rust

#![no_std]
#![feature(asm_const)]
#![feature(naked_functions)]

use core::arch::asm;
use core::panic::PanicInfo;

/// Entry point for the runtime
#[naked]
#[no_mangle]
#[link_section = ".text._start"]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn _start() -> ! {
    // Initialize stack pointer
    asm!(
        "la sp, {stack_start}",
        "j {main}",
        stack_start = sym _stack_start,
        main = sym main,
        options(noreturn)
    );
}

/// Default panic handler
#[panic_handler]
fn panic(_info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    loop {}
}

/// Minimal runtime initialization
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn main() -> ! {
    // Your application code would start here
    loop {}
}

/// Stack start symbol (defined in linker script)
extern "C" {
    static _stack_start: u32;
}

6. Other Runtime Considerations

More advanced runtimes might include:

    Interrupt Handling:

rust

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn trap_handler() {
    // Handle exceptions/interrupts
}

    Heap Allocation:

rust

use linked_list_allocator::LockedHeap;

#[global_allocator]
static ALLOCATOR: LockedHeap = LockedHeap::empty();

pub fn init_heap(start: usize, size: usize) {
    unsafe { ALLOCATOR.lock().init(start, size) };
}

    Standard Library Integration:

rust

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn _write(fd: i32, buf: *const u8, count: usize) -> i32 {
    // Implement system call for println! support
}

Building and Testing

To build:
bash

cargo build --release

To inspect the output:
bash

riscv-none-elf-objdump -d target/riscv32i-unknown-none-elf/release/riscv-runtime

This gives you a minimal but functional RISC-V runtime in Rust that you can extend with more features as needed.
